##  Purpose/Mission
Women Who Code Hackathon for Social Good 2023 

Many of us face challenges deciding about their next meal. But to some this minor inconvenience  can be completely debilitating. Sometimes to the point where it is a danger to ones health. With [ Food decider], we hope to cut down on the complexities and anxiety of meal decisions by providing only relevant data within the [ Food decider] app.Our app might not be able to completely solve the riddle of decision-stall but it can help with managing it. Making the meal decision easier for all.

We wanted to design a site to address ADHD Decision paralysis,  Dietary/Allergy management, and Food waste reduction.

## Description
 Our Focus Food app minimizes distractions by allowing users to swiftly select ingredients and presents recipes with minimal interruption, using a slot machine animation to maintain engagement. This approach optimizes the userâ€™s path to finding  a recipe, minimizing interruptions and ensuring a user-friendly, distraction-focused experience.
